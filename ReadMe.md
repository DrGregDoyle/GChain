We present a script-free, proof-of-work blockchain, designed to be a decentralized method of verifying and recording transactions of the tokens generated from the proof-of-work process.

For what follows, all elements of a given data structure will ultimately be an integer.
This integer can be expressed in binary form, decimal form or hexadecimal form and still represent the same value.
Hence we may refer to elements as 'hex strings' or 'binary strings' and it is understood that we are referring to the integer value.
